.SH NAME
dbak \- backup the files and folders using rsync

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dbak [OPTIONS] [-c FILE]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Backup all files and folders specified in the configuration
file, using rsync. Essentially this is a simple wrapper around
rsync to make it easier to perform automatic backups.

The configuration file ignores leading and trailing whitespace,
empty lines and lines starting with #. All paths must be absolute
to be valid. The first valid line must specify the destination
directory and all other lines can be either individual files or
directory paths, like so:

    # Destination
    /media/user/external_disk/Backups

    # Some configuration files
    /home/user/.bashrc
    /home/user/.nanorc

    # Some directories
    /home/user/.config/
    /etc/

.SH OPTIONS

.B \-h
